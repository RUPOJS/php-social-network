This is the code - structure for our DBMS project "Social Network". This is only the raw structure of the application just for creating the basic architecture for our project.Note that this application currently can not be recognized as a real social network it is just build to experiment the understanding of Relational databses and server side languages(PHP) but there is possibility that many real social network features will be included in near future. **IT IS ONLY THE BASIC CODE-BASE FOR THE APPLICATION**

The stylesheet(CSS) and javascript(jquery) files will be added soon with an updated version.
